## About the raw data

All the raw data was extracted from the website through GET

##Brief of objectives

In this research, I'll check the influence of wildfires on the concentration of air pollutant, including SO2 and CO, which are the main pollutants produced by wildfire. There was a great wildfire happened in 2018 from 11.08 to 11.25. So I'll collect the data of the concentration of air pollutant in 2018 from 11.08 to 11.25 and the data on the same date from 2013 to 2017 to check whether the concentration increased significantly because of the wildfire and how muuch it changed.

I'll also check the frequent words in the abstracts of the papers about SO2 and CO to find the clues of related diseases and other things.

##conclusion
I don't think the wildfire increase the concentration of SO2 because in the counties around where the wildfire in 2018 happened the concentration didn't increase significantly, and the average concentration of SO2 in the whole state decreased in 2018.
I don't think the wildfire increase the concentration of CO because in the counties around where the wildfire in 2018 happened the concentration didn't increase significantly, even though the average concentration of CO in the whole state increased in 2018.

For Carbon monoxide, most of the most freuent words aren't important, except "tobacco", maybe this implies that burning tobacco produces carbon monoxide.
For sulfur dioxide, most of the most freuent words aren't important, except "nitrogen","fuel","oxidation", maybe this implies that much of SO2 come from burning the fuel and other oxidation process. And perhaps oxynitride is usually produced along with SO2, or they have similiar harmful influence so they are usually discussed together.
I planned to analyse information on wikibedia to find more meaningful frequent words but I couldn't connect to it from R because I'm in China.
